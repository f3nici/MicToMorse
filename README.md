# MicToMorse

MicToMorse is an accessibility-focused project designed to help people with disabilities, such as quadriplegics who do not have the ability to speak, communicate by making simple sounds into a microphone. These sounds are converted into **Morse code (dots and dashes)** and then translated into **text**, with an optional **push-to-speak** feature for voice output.

## 🌐 Live Demo
A public version of the project is available here:  
👉 [MicToMorse Live](https://mictomorse.pages.dev)

No installation is required - just open the link in your browser, allow microphone access, and start communicating.

### Option 3: Deploy on GitHub Pages

This repository includes an automated deployment workflow for GitHub Pages. Once the Pages
site is enabled in your repository settings, every push to `f3nici` will:

1. Install dependencies with `npm ci`.
2. Build the Vite project with a GitHub Pages–friendly base path.
3. Upload the compiled `dist` directory and publish it to the `github-pages` environment.

If you need to trigger a manual deployment, you can also run the **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
workflow manually from the Actions tab.
